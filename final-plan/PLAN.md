# Voidcore — Implementation Plan

## Overview

**Voidcore** is a minimal, high-performance 3D game engine for the web. It targets stylized and low-poly games with a developer experience inspired by Three.js but engineered for drastically better performance. The hard performance target is **2000 draw calls at 60fps on recent mobile phones**.

## Design Philosophy

**Performance is architecture, not optimization.** Every structural decision — from data layout to sort strategy to uniform upload — traces back to the 16.6ms frame budget. The engine achieves performance through design, not through post-hoc profiling and patching.

**Minimal scope, done well.** Two materials (Basic + Lambert), one shadow-casting light type (directional), seven parametric primitives, one transparency technique (WBOIT), one post-processing effect (bloom). Each feature is complete and polished rather than broad and shallow.

**Familiar API, modern internals.** The public API uses factory functions and object-oriented patterns familiar to Three.js developers. Internally, the renderer operates on contiguous typed arrays for cache-friendly GPU upload. Users never see the SoA layout — they interact with objects that have named properties.

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Language | TypeScript strict, no semicolons, const arrow functions | Full type safety, clean code style |
| GPU primary | WebGPU | Lower per-draw overhead, immutable pipelines |
| GPU fallback | WebGL2 | Broad compatibility |
| Package structure | Single `voidcore` package with `/react` subpath export | Simple distribution, one version, one install |
| Public API style | Object graph with factory functions | Familiar DX, debuggable |
| Internal data layout | SoA typed arrays | Cache-friendly, GPU-uploadable |
| Coordinate system | Z-up, right-handed (X=right, Y=forward, Z=up) | Blender convention, prompt requirement |
| Materials | Basic (unlit) + Lambert (N·L diffuse) | Sufficient for stylized/low-poly |
| Transparency | Weighted Blended OIT | No sorting, single-pass, no ordering artifacts |
| Shadows | 3-cascade CSM, 1024px default | Smooth shadows for 200m worlds |
| Bloom | Unreal-style progressive downsample/upsample | Per-vertex emissive control via MRT |
| BVH | Binned SAH, flat 32-byte nodes | three-mesh-bvh quality target |
| Animation | GPU skinning, 4-bone, action-based mixer | glTF skeletal animation with crossfade |
| Assets | glTF 2.0 + Draco + KTX2/Basis | Standard pipeline, worker-decoded |
| React bindings | Custom reconciler at `voidcore/react` | R3F-style declarative scene, same package |
| Math | Custom Float32Array-backed, functional API | Zero-alloc, Z-up baked in, GPU-uploadable |
| Draw call sorting | 64-bit radix sort | O(n), stable, predictable |
| Uniforms | Dynamic offsets on shared buffer | Minimal binding overhead |
| Instancing | None | Per-draw overhead <2-3μs makes it unnecessary at 2000 draws |

## Package Structure

```
voidcore/
  src/
    math/           # Vec3, Mat4, Quat, AABB, Frustum, Ray
    device/         # GPU abstraction (Device, Buffer, Texture, Pipeline, BindGroup)
    renderer/       # Render loop, draw call sorting, state management
    scene/          # Scene graph, nodes, transforms, dirty flags
    materials/      # BasicMaterial, LambertMaterial, shader variants
    geometry/       # Parametric primitives, buffer layouts
    animation/      # Skeleton, AnimationMixer, crossfade, bone attachment
    loaders/        # glTF, Draco, KTX2/Basis
    lighting/       # Directional light, ambient light, CSM shadows
    spatial/        # BVH, raycasting, frustum culling
    postfx/         # Bloom, MSAA, OIT composite, tone mapping
    controls/       # OrbitControls
    overlay/        # HTML overlay system
    react/          # Custom reconciler, Canvas, hooks, Html component
      reconciler.ts
      Canvas.tsx
      hooks.ts
      Html.tsx
      components.ts
  package.json
```

The React bindings live inside the main package and are exposed via a `/react` subpath export in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "voidcore",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./dist/index.js",
    "./react": "./dist/react/index.js"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
  },
  "peerDependenciesMeta": {
    "react": { "optional": true },
    "react-dom": { "optional": true }
  }
}
```

Users who don't use React pay zero cost — `react` and `react-dom` are optional peer dependencies, and the `/react` export is never imported unless explicitly used. Tree-shaking eliminates all React code from non-React bundles.

```typescript
// Vanilla usage — no React dependency loaded
import { createEngine, createScene, createMesh } from 'voidcore'

// React usage — imports reconciler, Canvas, hooks
import { Canvas, useFrame, useGLTF } from 'voidcore/react'
```
