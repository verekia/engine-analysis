# Math

This topic was not explicitly specified in the original shark implementation proposal.

Standard math utilities for a 3D engine include:
- Coordinate system: Z-up, right-handed (as per standardization requirements)
- Vector math (Vec2, Vec3, Vec4)
- Matrix math (Mat3, Mat4)
- Quaternions for rotations
- Common operations: transforms, interpolation, etc.
