# API Design

This topic was not explicitly specified in the original shark implementation proposal.

API design philosophy can be inferred from other documents:
- See REACT.md for React bindings and declarative API patterns
- See RENDERER.md for low-level rendering API
- See SCENE-GRAPH.md for scene graph manipulation API
- See CONTROLS.md for camera and interaction API
