# Geometry

## Overview

This topic was not explicitly detailed in the rabbit implementation documentation. The implementation likely includes standard geometry primitives (plane, box, sphere, cone, cylinder, capsule, circle) as part of the core geometry system, but specific implementation details were not provided.

## Standard Primitives

The engine is expected to support the following geometry primitives:

- **Plane**: Flat rectangular surface
- **Box**: Cubic geometry with configurable dimensions
- **Sphere**: Spherical geometry with configurable radius and subdivision
- **Cone**: Conical geometry
- **Cylinder**: Cylindrical geometry
- **Capsule**: Pill-shaped geometry (cylinder with hemispherical caps)
- **Circle**: Flat circular surface

These primitives would typically be generated procedurally and stored in the geometry format used by the mesh system.
